select worker.empno AS EmployeeNumber, worker.ename AS EmployeeName,worker.hiredate AS Hiredate, mgr.ename AS MgrName
from emp worker inner join emp mgr
on worker.mgr=mgr.empno
where trim(mgr.ename) LIKE 'K%' or trim(mgr.ename) LIKE 'M%' or trim(mgr.ename) LIKE 'S%' ;


test run

SQL> select worker.empno AS EmployeeNumber, worker.ename AS EmployeeName,worker.hiredate AS Hiredate, mgr.ename AS MgrName
  2  from emp worker inner join emp mgr
  3  on worker.mgr=mgr.empno
  4  where trim(mgr.ename) LIKE 'K%' or trim(mgr.ename) LIKE 'M%' or trim(mgr.ename) LIKE 'S%';

#2. Create a query that will display the [employee name, department number, department name] and [all the employees that work in the same department as a given employee]. Give each column an appropriate label.



select e.empno AS EmployeeNumber, e.ename AS Employees, d.deptno AS DepartmentNumber, d.dname AS Department
from emp e, dept d
where e.deptno = d.deptno and e.deptno =  (select deptno from emp where ename='ADAMS') and ename != 'ADAMS';

test run

SQL> select e.empno AS EmployeeNumber, e.ename AS Employees, d.deptno AS DepartmentNumber, d.dname AS Department
  2  from emp e, dept d
  3  where e.deptno = d.deptno
  4  and e.deptno =  (select deptno from emp where ename='ADAMS') and ename != 'ADAMS';

#3. Write a query to display the department name, location of all employees who are clerks.
inner join between emp and dept

select d.dname,d.loc,e.job
from  dept d inner join emp e
on e.deptno=d.deptno and e.JOB='CLERK'

test run


SQL> select d.dname,d.loc,e.job
  2  from  dept d inner join emp e
  3  on e.deptno=d.deptno and e.JOB='CLERK';

SALES	       CHICAGO	     CLERK




#4. Insert a new row into the department table: department number = 50, department name = training, location = San Francisco. Now create a query to display all the employees in department number 20 and 50. Columns to be displayed are emp number, emp name, dept name, dept location.


INSERT INTO dept (deptno,dname,loc)values('50','training','San Francisco');

select e.empno,e.ename,d.dname,d.loc
from emp e RIGHT OUTER JOIN dept d 
on e.deptno=d.deptno

test run
 
SQL> select e.empno,e.ename,d.dname,d.loc
  2  from emp e RIGHT OUTER JOIN dept d
  3  on e.deptno=d.deptno;

#5. Insert a new row into the emp table - you can choose any values for the fields, but department number should be null. Now create a query to display all the employees and all the departments, using joins.



INSERT INTO EMP2 (EMPNO,ENAME,JOB,MGR,HIREDATE,SAL,COMM,DEPTNO) values('1111','syuta','ANALYST','7566','17-DEC-80','3000',NULL,NULL)

select e.ename,d.deptno
from emp2 e FULL OUTER JOIN dept d
on e.deptno=d.deptno;

test run


SQL> select e.ename,d.deptno,e.sal,d.dname.d.loc,e.job
  2  from emp2 e FULL OUTER JOIN dept d
  3  on e.deptno=d.deptno;
